### Things implemented
* Double jump, by making a double-jump flag for detecting if it is on the middle of the air for jump or no.
* Crouch, haven't change the collision capsule, but used as the way to activate the objective.
* Dash, using time ticks to do a dash movemnt, and making the speed of movement 3 times faster.
* Lerpy movement, the movement becomes much more smoother to move.
* Level design, where I put stock jungle photo and added some level design with the object in the game.
* Making script for game condition. If crouch in the certain area, you get a victory message.
